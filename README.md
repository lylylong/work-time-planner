# Work Time Planner

## Description

This calendar application is a very efficient time management tool. It's designed for all busy schedule employees or students, and they can save their daily events for each hour of the day.

The application has a clean user interface and provides a simple user experience:

1. When the user opens the application, they can see the current date and time. There are colour references on top of the time rows, it simply tells the user about the color code, which indicates whether it is in the past, present, or future.

2. To save any time slot event:
   The user clicks into the text area and inputs the event for that corresponding hour. By clicking the "Save Plan" button on the right side, that new event will be saved. If the user refreshes the page, he/she will find the data persists.

3. To edit any time slot event:
   By clicking the text area, the user can start to edit that event. After the editing, just click "Save Plan" to save the revised events.

4. To delete any time slot event:
   The user can clear one slot of the schedule by clicking the 'Remove' button, or click on the text area -> select all -> delete -> click "Save Plan" to save the empty event.

5. When that user restarts the computer and re-opens the application, they can see all the saved events persist, because these data are saved in local storage.
